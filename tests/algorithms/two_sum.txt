Check if any two numbers in [2, 7, 11, 15] sum to 9 using a set of seen numbers.

Create an array with values [2, 7, 11, 15].
Let the target be 9.
Create an empty set called "seen".
Let found be False.

For each number in the array:
  Calculate the complement (target minus current number).
  Check if the complement is in the seen set.
  If yes:
    Set found to True.
  Add the current number to the seen set.

Print the value of found (should be True, since 2 + 7 = 9).
