Compute the average of an array using a helper function for the sum.

Input: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Define a function called compute_sum that takes an array:
  Set total to 0.
  For each number in the array, add the number to total.
  Return total.

Call compute_sum with the input array and store the result in sum.
Let count be the length of the array.
Let average be sum divided by count.

Print average.
